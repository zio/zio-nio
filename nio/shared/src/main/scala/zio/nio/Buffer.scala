/**
 * Mutable buffer of value elements.
 *
 * This wraps one of the Java NIO buffer classes. Most of
 * [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/Buffer.html the Java documentation]] is applicable to this
 * class.
 *
 * Buffer instances are in no way synchronized and are typically used from a single fiber. Extract immutable `Chunk`s to
 * pass values to other fibers or via streams.
 *
 * =Construction=
 *
 * There is a concrete buffer subclass for each primitive type. There are three ways to create a buffer:
 *
 * ==Allocation==
 *
 * Simply allocates a new buffer on the heap of a certain size, for example `Buffer.byte(100)`, `Buffer.char(200)`.
 *
 * For `ByteBuffer` there is the special case of direct buffers, which can be constructed via `Buffer.byteDirect`. See
 * the Java docs for details of the advantages and disadvantages of direct byte buffers.
 *
 * ==Wrapping==
 *
 * Buffers can wrap existing Java buffers, or ZIO `Chunk`s. Care must be taken when wrapping Java buffers that the
 * wrapped buffer is not subsequently modified; these objects are typically wrapped to provide efficient
 * interoperability with Java APIs.
 *
 * A `CharBuffer` can also wrap any `java.lang.CharSequence`.
 *
 * ==Views==
 *
 * While `ByteBuffer`s are created via allocation or wrapping, the other buffer types are more commonly constructed as a
 * ''view'' over a `ByteBuffer`. Each numeric buffer class supports either big-endian or little-endian byte order as
 * required.
 *
 * View buffers are constructed via the various `asXXX` methods on the [[zio.nio.ByteBuffer]] class, for example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   val ints(implicit trace: Trace): UIO[IntBuffer] = bytes.asIntBuffer
 * }}}
 *
 * Changes to made via view buffers are reflected in the original `ByteBuffer` and vice-versa.
 *
 * =Differences from Java=
 *
 * The Java API supports "invocation chaining", which does not work with effect values. The Java example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   b.flip().position(23).limit(42)
 * }}}
 *
 * is typically written:
 *
 * {{{
 *   for {
 *     _ <- b.flip
 *     _ <- b.position(23)
 *     _ <- b.limit(42)
 *   } yield ()
 * }}}
 *
 * or in cases like this when the intermediate values aren't used:
 *
 * {{{
 *   b.flip *> b.position(23) *> b.limit(42)
 * }}}
