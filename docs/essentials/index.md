ZIO-NIO is a ZIO wrapper on Java NIO. It comes in two flavours:

 - `zio.nio.core` - a small and unopionanted ZIO interface to NIO that just wraps NIO API in ZIO effects,
 - `zio.nio` - an opinionated interface with deeper ZIO integration that provides more type and resource safety.

A very simple example of these differences would be the signature of `apply` method on `AsynchronousSocketChannel`:
```scala
//zio.nio.core
def apply(): IO[Exception, AsynchronousSocketChannel]
```
vs
```scala
//zio.nio
def apply(): Managed[Exception, AsynchronousSocketChannel]
```

## Installation

`ZIO-NIO` is available via maven repo. Add this to your dependencies in `sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %% "zio-nio-core" % "1.0.0-RC6"
```
or
```scala
libraryDependencies += "dev.zio" %% "zio-nio" % "1.0.0-RC6"
```

## Main abstractions

 - **[File Channel](files.md)** — For processing files that are available locally. For every operation a new fiber is started to perform operation
 - **[Socket Channel](sockets.md)** — Provides API for remote communication with `InetSocket`s
